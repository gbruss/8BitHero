● 8-Bit Hero
● Formerly Team B: Garrett Bruss, Avery Brown, Joshua Mariano, Shyheim McNair-mann
● Classic Rhythm Game

● Actuate the notes at the correct time to increase your score and health
● Mistiming notes will result in less points for your score
● Each poorly timed note causes a decrease in health, every 5 well timed note increases health

● Actuate Notes: Left/right/up/down arrows
● Maximize Window: F4
● Close Program: F10

YET TO BE IMPLEMENTED FEATURES:
● Right now the note spawners simply spawn all the notes at an interval; the bulk of the remaining work is engineering note spawns.
● Although mistiming the arrow keys will result in loss of health/points, allowing a note to pass through doesn't do anything yet.
● Currently having your health reduced to 0 doesn't end the game; in final functionality, 0 hp results in failure, and health caps at 100.
● All sprites and sounds are placeholders, and animations are yet to be implemented.
● Menus
● Obstacles to impede the player
